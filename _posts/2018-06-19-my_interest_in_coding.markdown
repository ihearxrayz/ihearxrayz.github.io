Well what got me to wanting to write code was the technology aspect of it mainly. We all obviously know that tech and automation will be the future. So I do now what to get left behind. I want to know what the machines are actually doing in their language to understand thier commands. I also like reading and writing naturally, so coding seems to be a great fit for me. Not to mention I was taught Spanish growing up and learned German the past few years so languages do interest me. I also just met this German guy during the Mexico vs. Germany game and he metioned something very interesting. A German man whose name escapes me at the moment, described the human body as a machine. He made him sound super awesome.
