I have recently found out about the compound effect. Essentially doing something daily will turn that something into a lifestyle. You can think about it defining you. We all know our time here is finite and what we do with it will define our life. A daily habit will turn into a weekly habit, which will turn into a monthly habit, which turns into a yearly habit, which turns to a decade. It is paramount to use time wisely. I must cut the nonessential tasks out of my daily habits. No more looking up useless memes or staying too long on a social media app. Those are by far the major part of my time wasted. And by all means I am not saying leisure time is wasted time, but quality leisure time is acheived when the work has been done. Free time becomes super precious when you know all of what you need to do has been done. When an important achievement has been reached. When major projects are done to perfection or at least to the best of your abilities. My time will be divided into making these things better: coding, German and Spanish, eating healthy, and training for a triathlon. This is who I will become.
