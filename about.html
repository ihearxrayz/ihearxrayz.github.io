<p>After 27 years of not accomplishing what I truly want, I am now turning things around. My health has never been better after switching to primarily eating fruits and vegetables. After getting into the habit of good diet, I started working out to eventually do an Ironman triathlon. After a couple of month of doing that, I learned to keep going with any task even though it might be hard, hurt, or seem achievable.  Working out also taught me anything IS achievable with the power of persistence. Never giving up is key to success. And know I am wanting t be a great coder. I will persist until my goals are a reality!</p>
